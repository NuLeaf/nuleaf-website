## Setting Up Everything Needed (instructions are a work in progress)
If you're reading this and you haven't already signed up for GitHub, shame on you!

### Summary Lists
Accounts you'll need to sign up for:  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
- [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/www-header) (You do not have to enter *Company Name*)

Stuff you need to install (this is a list summary, see more detailed steps below if need be):
- Git, which you can get [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or from GitHub (see optional next step)
- **Optional**: GitHub's GUI client for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/)
  - This will also install Git
  - If you do choose to use the GUI client, it is still recommended (*-cough-* required *-cough-*) you learn the Git basics on the command line.
- The [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) for Windows/OSX or [LAMP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) for Linux
- An SFTP client (this will vary depending on your OS and preferences). Some options:
  - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) for Windows
  - [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for all platforms
  - [`sftp` on the command line](https://docs.joyent.com/guides/ssh-guide/using-sftp-to-transfer-files/sftp-from-the-command-line) for Mac/Linux
