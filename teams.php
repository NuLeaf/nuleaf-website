    <p class="section-title">Bio-inspired</p>
    The natural world has been solving the same physical problems that mankind is faced with today for the last 3.8 billion years.  There is incredible, untapped knowledge is this immense wealth of  
    experience.  Each step forward should be grounded in a respect of our natural roots. Collaborating with nature will take us to innovative, more efficient technological heights. 

    <p class="section-title">Interdisciplinary</p>
    An interdisciplinary project involves reaching across different scientific fields to acknowledge the multi-faceted nature of the world around us.  Though vastly different, we are all connected.  By    
    extension, all scientific disciplines are connected.   The sooner we embrace this fact, the sooner we will be able to the produce the best technology possible from a core of intellectual excellence.

    <p class="section-title">Sustainable</p>
    Living on a healthy planet is so fundamental it should be common sense.  To preserve nature’s wonders is to preserve our way of life.  Operating in a sustainable manner is currently a challenge that 
    can only be overcome with tenacity, integrity, and creativity.  Although difficult, adapting our technology to live in harmony with the natural world around us is truly the only logical course.  

    <p class="section-title">Education</p>
    A good team is continually growing and learning.  The better we make our team, the better our work will be, and member’s personal and professional growth is of paramount importance.  We aim to provide 
    our members with access to numerous scientific resources, including STEMinars, so that they can develop skills valuable to their future careers.

    <p class="section-title">Community</p>
    This is an ambitious, difficult research project with high standards, and we want our members will look back fondly on the experience.  We will foster an atmosphere of trust and positive communication 
    with an incredibly diverse group of students.  This includes building a fun-loving, but serious, environment where young scientists come together to solve wide-ranging scientific problems.
