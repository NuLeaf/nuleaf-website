    <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
    <p>
        Producing electricity from plants is a powerful, established concept evident in up-and-coming research.  Past methods have involved the use of nanotechnology or natural soil chemistry.  These   
        studies demonstrate both feasibility and ability to commercialize.  However, previous investigations are limited by their low power generation, interference with natural plant processes, and     
        reliance on the inefficiency of the photosynthetic pathway.<br><br>
        In contrast, this project proposes a technique that could harness higher levels of power with minimal ecological impact.  The process will not rely on photosynthesis and will be harmlessly      
        integrated into the plant’s biological system and surrounding environment.  This research hinges upon nanogenetics and the use of the plant’s own carbon storage or other biological pathways to 
        create the nanoparticles of the coating and bioelectric network.  In comparison to solar panels, this project has the potential to be cheaper, less toxic, and more efficient by using natural 
        materials and not requiring constant maintenance.

    <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to develop a mechanism by which electricity can be generated from plants in a biologically harmless manner. This involves the genetic development of a nanoscale  
        optical coating on the leaves that will absorb light not used in photosynthesis. The heat captured by the coating will be transferred to electricity through a carbon nanotube network within the 
        plant to a root wiring mesh and external power harvester.<br><br>
        Our teams will focus on the modeling of protein-nanostructure interactions, genetic engineering to create the optical coating and bioelectric network, 
        and conductive root wiring mesh and external power harvester development. Additional literature search teams will guide our bio-inspired research 
        to ensure the project’s commitment to healthy integration in the plant and ecosystem. The first stage of the project is team 
        formation and an extended literature search. This project is committed to scientific excellence and to 
        teaching young scientists through “STEMinars” and real- world experience to help them gain confidence to develop both personally and professionally for their future careers.
    </p>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <p>
        1. Reflected photons are captured by the coating on the plant’s leaf<br>
        2. Coating becomes hot and the heat is transferred to electricity<br>
        3. Electrons are funneled down the bioelectric network in the plant<br>
        4. Root wiring mesh collects electrons and directs them through soil<br>
        5. Energy is harvested and is made usable for consumers
    </p>
    <h4>PROGRESS TO DATE</h4>
    <p>
        Our first research steps are an extensive literature search and generation of experimental design reports aimed to define proof of concept.  We plan to pursue sources of funding such as grants,  
        academic institutions such as Foothill College, and scientific organizations like AVS. We aim to continually recruit top student talent from Silicon Valley academic institutions to ensure the 
        successful completion of the project. 
    </p>
    <h4>UPCOMING PLANS</h4>
    <p>
        The proposal is three months old.  The project lead gave several presentations for recruitment.  Nearly 150 people applied and now 14 teams with a total of 60 people are established.  These 
        students come from various scientific backgrounds, including biology, chemistry, psychology, kinesiology, animation, and computer science, to name a few.  The education of students ranges from 
        lower division undergraduate to master programs.  The STEMinars, in which students, industry professionals, and established scientists give lectures, have begun.
